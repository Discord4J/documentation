## Enabling Auto Complete

To enable auto complete, just add `autocomplete: true` to a command option that supports autocomplete. It can only be
added to the `STRING`, `NUMBER`, and `INTEGER` type options. Autocomplete cannot be used on commands that have `choices`
provided.


## Receiving and Responding

Once auto complete is enabled on a command option, discord will automatically start sending auto complete interactions
when a user is typing the parameter.

:::caution
Auto complete choices are only a suggestion! The user can choose to ignore the suggestions and input a custom value.
:::

```java
client.on(ChatInputAutoCompleteEvent.class, event -> {
    if (event.getCommandName().equals("commandName")) {
        // Get the string value of what the user is currently typing
        String typing = event.getFocusedOption().getValue()
                .map(ApplicationCommandInteractionOptionValue::asString)
                .orElse(""); // In case the user has not started typing, we return an empty string

        /*
        Build a list of choices to present to the user as suggested input

        For the sake of simplicity in this demo, we are returning a static list here.
        Ideally you would use fuzzy matching or other techniques to suggest up to 25 choices for the user.
        */
        List<ApplicationCommandOptionChoiceData> suggestions = new ArrayList<>();

        suggestions.add(ApplicationCommandOptionChoiceData.builder().name("Thing 1").value("value").build());
        suggestions.add(ApplicationCommandOptionChoiceData.builder().name("Something 2").value("other").build());
        suggestions.add(ApplicationCommandOptionChoiceData.builder().name("some other input").value("pick me").build());

        // Finally, return the list of choices to the user
        return event.respondWithSuggestions(suggestions);
    }
}).subscribe();
```

Unlike other interactions, autocomplete cannot be deferred and only has one way to respond.
The bot must respond within 3 seconds, failure to do so will result in a "soft failure" in the discord client; the user
will still be able to use the command,but the autocomplete box will show an error.
