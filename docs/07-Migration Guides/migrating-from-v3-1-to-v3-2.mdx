This article should help you update your bot from Discord4J v3.1.x to v3.2.0. This new major release is over a year
in the making and has lots of changes.

## Before you start

:::note
If you encounter an issue while following this guide or discover something missing, feel free to suggest changes or discuss them in our [server](https://discord.gg/d4j). Thanks!

## Updating dependencies

Discord4J v3.2 depends on Reactor 2020 release train ([Reactor Core](https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core) 3.4.x and [Reactor Netty](https://github.com/reactor/reactor-netty) 1.0.x). It maintains the JDK 8 baseline and includes other dependency upgrades like:

- discord-json 1.6 (from 1.5)
- jackson-databind 2.12 (from 2.11)
- caffeine 2.8 (new dependency)

### Gradle

```groovy
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  implementation 'com.discord4j:discord4j-core:3.2.0'
}
```

### Maven

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.discord4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>discord4j-core</artifactId>
        <version>3.2.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Discord4J features

### Gateway Intents

The intent system is now mandatory in the Gateway version used with v3.2. To retain the previous behavior, use `setEnabledIntents(IntentSet.all())` when building a Gateway-capable client. For more information about this feature check [official docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-intents).

```java
GatewayDiscordClient client = DiscordClient.create(System.getenv("token"))
        .gateway()
        .setEnabledIntents(IntentSet.all())
        .login()
        .block();
```

Otherwise the default will be `IntentSet.nonPrivileged()`. Discord might be changing the set of non-privileged intents in the future, particularly message create [becoming privileged in 2022](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404772028055).

If you get an error such as `WebSocket closed: 4014 Disallowed intent(s)`, make sure you're allowed to use the intents you enabled, this can be done in your developer portal bot page, look for **Privileged Gateway Intents**.

### New entity cache API

One of the most notable change is the way our `Store` abstraction works for entity caching. If you use a custom `StoreService`, for quick migration you need to adapt it in this way:

```java
GatewayDiscordClient client = DiscordClient.create(System.getenv("token"))
        .gateway()
        .setStore(Store.fromLayout(LegacyStoreLayout.of(myStoreService)))
        .login()
        .block();
```

Where `myStoreService` is what you used previously, for instance:

```java
StoreService myStoreService = MappingStoreService.create()
    .setMapping(new NoOpStoreService(), MessageData.class)
    .setFallback(new JdkStoreService());
```

### New bot presence API

After [#874](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/pull/874), you have to update how bot presence is set when connecting and updated:

- Use `ClientPresence` instead of `Presence`
- Use `ClientActivity` instead of `Activity`
- Prefer calling `setInitialPresence` over `setInitialStatus`
- This also affects methods like `GatewayDiscordClient::updatePresence`

```java
DiscordClient.create(System.getenv("token"))
        .gateway()
        .setInitialPresence(s -> ClientPresence.invisible())
        .withGateway(client -> client.on(ReadyEvent.class)
                .doOnNext(ready -> log.info("Logged in as {}", ready.getSelf().getUsername()))
                .then())
        .block();
```

### New request spec API

A large effort was introduced in [#927](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/pull/927) that provides different patterns of building and executing API requests to Discord. This addresses some issues of the `Consumer`-based specs when used for templating, and allows more fluent calls for convenience.

Consider the following example of spec usage in 3.1.x:
```java
channel.createMessage(msg -> {
  msg.setContent("Hello @everyone");
  msg.setAllowedMentions(AllowedMentions.suppressEveryone());
  msg.addEmbed(embed -> {
    embed.setTitle("Foo");
    embed.addField("Bar", "Baz", false);
    embed.setColor(Color.BLUE);
  });
})
```

The `createMessage` method takes a `Consumer<MessageCreateSpec>`. In other words, the spec is "given to you" by the
method, and you mutate that spec to put it in the state you want. While it works well, this pattern was often confusing
to users, most notably because you couldn't ever really "hold" a spec. It was a kind of ephemeral thing that could only
be given to you in these mutating Consumers.

In 3.2, we sought to "materialize" specs. Specs are now immutable data carriers that can be built in a few different
ways. The way you pick is purely up to your preference.

#### Builder
The most obvious way to build an object in Java is the builder pattern. This works exactly how you think it would.
```java
channel.createMessage(MessageCreateSpec.builder()
  .content("Hello @everyone")
  .allowedMentions(AllowedMentions.suppressEveryone())
  .addEmbed(EmbedCreateSpec.builder()
    .title("Foo")
    .addField("Bar", "Baz", false)
    .color(Color.BLUE)
    .build())
  .build())
```

Any spec, `SomeSpec`, has a static method `SomeSpec.builder()` which will return a `SomeSpec.Builder`.

#### Withers
In addition to a builder, all specs come equipped with "wither" (or `withX`) methods that return a copy of the current
spec with a modified field. The above example could be equivalently written as...
```java
channel.createMessage(MessageCreateSpec.create()
  .withContent("Hello @everyone")
  .withAllowedMentions(AllowedMentions.suppressEveryone())
  .withEmbeds(EmbedCreateSpec.create()
    .withTitle("Foo")
    .withFields(EmbedCreateFields.Field.of("Bar", "Baz", false))
    .withColor(Color.BLUE)))
```

Similar to `builder()`, specs also have a static `create()` method that returns a minimal, default spec which can be
modified using the wither methods.

#### Fluent Publishers
Finally, most methods that accept specs also have a parameter-less (or minimal parameters) overload that instead returns
a special `Mono` or `Flux`. These publishers have methods corresponding to each property of the spec. This allows for
fluent calls to these methods.
```java
channel.createMessage("Hello @everyone")
  .withAllowedMentions(AllowedMentions.suppressEveryone())
  .withEmbeds(EmbedCreateSpec.create()
    .withTitle("Foo")
    .withFields(EmbedCreateFields.Field.of("Bar", "Baz", false))
    .withColor(Color.BLUE)))
```

For a supported spec, `SomeActionSpec`, there will be a corresponding publisher `SomeAction(Mono/Flux)`. Note that this
isn't supported for all specs. As you can see above, the parameter to `withEmbeds` isn't included in the surrounding
fluent chain (and we could have chosen to use a builder there if we wanted).

#### Legacy Specs
To aide migration, we will continue to support the previous spec behavior in 3.2. The old ("legacy") specs have been
moved to `discord4j.core.spec.legacy`, and had `Legacy` prepended to their names. For example, 3.1's
`discord4j.core.spec.MessageCreateSpec` is now `discord4j.core.spec.legacy.LegacyMessageCreateSpec` in 3.2.

This means that any code using specs like `foo(spec -> ...)` will continue to work without issues, but if you directly
imported a spec class, you will need to update the package, as it was moved to `discord4j.core.spec.legacy` package and
all `XxSpec` classes were deprecated and renamed to `LegacyXxSpec`.

:::warning
These legacy specs are deprecated. They exist only to make migration a bit easier, and they _will_ be removed in a
future version. Please let us know if the current alternatives are not a good fit for your use case.

### Interactions

This feature is under development from Discord therefore we have marked it as **Experimental**, meaning breaking changes can happen between minor versions (in D4J that is from x.y.z to x.y.z+1). A new hierarchy was introduced after the inclusion of context menus in [#1001](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/pull/1001)

- Event
    - InteractionCreateEvent
        - ApplicationCommandInteractionEvent
            - ChatInputInteractionEvent
            - MessageInteractionEvent
            - UserInteractionEvent
        - ComponentInteractionEvent
            - ButtonInteractionEvent
            - SelectMenuInteractionEvent

#### Renamed interaction types

The following versions are affected and need to migrate to these types when upgrading:

- v3.1.7
- v3.2.0-RC3

| Previous | New |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| SlashCommandEvent | ChatInputInteractionEvent |
| ComponentInteractEvent | ComponentInteractionEvent |
| ButtonInteractEvent | ButtonInteractionEvent |
| SelectMenuInteractEvent | SelectMenuInteractionEvent |

#### Webhook execution

If you used `WebhookMultipartRequest` for your slash command application in v3.1 you now have to migrate to `MultipartRequest<WebhookExecuteRequest>`.

For example, to reply ephemerally to a command, the below code can now be used:
```java
ChatInputInteractionEvent#reply("Content!")
    .withEphemeral(true)
    .subscribe();
```

For more information regarding how to respond to slash commands with the new method, see [Application Commands - Responding](/interactions/application-commands#responding-to-commands)

## Advanced features

### Directly querying a store

The recommended way is using `EntityRetrievalStrategy.STORE` for methods that support it. However if it's not available for your use case and used `StateView` before, you now have to migrate to querying a `Store` directly, available from `GatewayResources`.

This abstraction is now focused on query objects, named `ReadActions`. A quick example to get the cached user count:

```java
// client is a GatewayDiscordClient instance
Store store = client.getGatewayResources().getStore();
long userCount = Mono.from(store.execute(ReadActions.countUsers())).block();
```

### Customizing a `StoreLayout`

The entity cache from v3.1 set a structure that's too rigid for some implementations, so a new interface `StoreLayout` was created to abstract the read/write process that bots needs to handle when connecting to the Discord Gateway to maintain a cache. v3.2 now defaults to `Store.fromLayout(LocalStoreLayout.create())` as the new in-memory entity cache.

A `LocalStoreLayout` configures a set of defaults as well through `StorageConfig`:

- Since messages have a larger storage footprint, a [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine) cache `StorageBackend` is set to 1000 of the most recent messages
- Set to remove all content under stale cache conditions like a non-resumable reconnect or logout

These options can be configured through a builder using: `LocalStoreLayout.create(StorageConfig.builder().build())`

For an example implementation beyond what's built-in, check this project from Discord4J contributor @napstr: https://github.com/CapybaraLabs/d4j-postgres-store
