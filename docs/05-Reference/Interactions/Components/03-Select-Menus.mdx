## Select Menus

:::note
For information on how to use Select Menus, see [How-to Guides - Select Menus](/interactions/select-menus).
:::

Select menus allow a dropdown to be displayed on a message itself rather than only inside the command input window.

Like Buttons, select menus must be inside of an `ActionRow`

:::caution
You can have up to one select menu per `ActionRow`.

Action rows with select menus cannot have buttons.
