## Buttons

:::note
For information on how to use buttons, see [How-to Guides - Buttons](/interactions/buttons).
:::

Buttons are interactive components on a Message. Similar to the old-school reaction buttons, these provide cleaner UI/UX than a small reaction button and are the preferred way of handling such inputs now.

Buttons must be inside an `ActionRow`

:::caution
You can have up to 5 `Button`s within each `ActionRow`.

Action rows with buttons cannot have select menus.

### Button Styles

Button styles offer a number of ways for a button to display

| Style     | Description                            |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| PRIMARY   | A blurple button                       |
| SECONDARY | A grey button                          |
| SUCCESS   | A green button                         |
| DANGER    | A red button                           |

:::caution
`LINK` style buttons cannot have a `custom_id` and will not send an interaction event when a user clicks on it.
:::

### Disabled buttons

Buttons can be disabled to prevent user interaction. When set to `disabled` the button will appear grayed out.
