## Interaction Hierarchy

Discord sends a single event over the gateway for all interactions. Discord4J breaks this down into separate event classes allowing a better development experience for handling the interactions you care about. We use the following hierarchy to accomplish this.

## Application Commands

:::note
For information on how to use application commands, see [How-to Guides - Application Commands](/interactions/application-commands).
:::

Application commands encompass several types of interactions:
* A chat input command (formerly "slash command"), which allows users to type a command in the chat box.
* Message command, which allows right-clicking on a message and using a context menu interaction (ex. "star message").
* Or User command, which allows right-clicking on a user and using a context menu interaction (ex. "temp mute").

In order for guilds to use application commands your bot has created, it is required that the bot be invited with the `applications.commands` scope in addition to the `bot` scope.

Application commands can be registered globally (accessible to all guilds that your bot is invited to), or per-guild; allowing each guild to have their own unique commands as they see fit.


### Chat Input (Slash Commands)

#### Options
Chat input commands can have `options`. These are just like arguments in a method, but for discord commands.

#### Option Types
Discord provides several built in types for options that define how each of them behave and their data type.

| Name              | Value | Note                                                             |
|-------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SUB_COMMAND       | 1     |                                                                  |
| SUB_COMMAND_GROUP | 2     | Transparent to the user; a way to organize your commands in code |
| STRING            | 3     |                                                                  |
| INTEGER           | 4     | Any integer between -2^53 and 2^53                               |
| BOOLEAN           | 5     |                                                                  |
| USER              | 6     |                                                                  |
| CHANNEL           | 7     | Includes all channel types + categories                          |
| ROLE              | 8     |                                                                  |
| MENTIONABLE       | 9     | Includes all users/roles                                         |
| NUMBER            | 10    | Any floating point number between -2^53 and 2^53                 |
| ATTACHMENT        | 11    | File attachment                                                  |

#### Choices

Choices can be defined on the `STRING`, `INTEGER`, and `NUMBER` option types. `choices` are preset values the user can pick when selecting the option that contains them.

:::caution
If you specify choices for an option, these are the only valid values a user may pick.
:::

### Message Commands

Message commands are a type of application command that is visible in the right click context menu of a message.

Message commands, unlike chat input, do not support options or descriptions.

### User Commands

User commands are a type of application command that is visible in the right click context menu of a user.

User commands, unlike chat input, do not support options or descriptions.

## Auto Complete

:::note
For information on how to use Auto Complete, see [How-to Guides - Auto Complete](/interactions/auto-complete).
:::

Auto complete allows a bot to give the user suggestions when the user is typing a command option with auto complete enabled.
It can be used for a variety of use cases, the most common being to suggest the correct input when more than 25 options are needed.
It is only available for `STRING`, `NUMBER`, and `INTEGER` option types and up to 25 suggestions can be provided at a time.

Unlike other interactions, auto complete cannot be deferred and requires only one response within 3 seconds.

## Method summary

When you receive an interaction event, you can choose how to handle it, but it must be only **one** of the following
and must be completed within a three-second window after Discord sends the interaction event.

| Method     | Application Command events            |
|------------|---------------------------------------|
| deferReply | No message, user sees a loading state |
| reply      | Include a message                     |

| Method                 | Autocomplete events             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| respondWithSuggestions | Up 25 choices will be displayed |

| Method     | Component events                                  |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| deferReply | No message, user sees a loading state             |
| reply      | Include a message                                 |
| deferEdit  | No message, user **does not** see a loading state |
| edit       | Update the message that originated the event      |

After the initial response is complete, you can work with the interaction using the following methods:

| Method         | Any DeferrableInteraction event                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| editReply      | Update the initial response                       |
| getReply       | Fetch the initial response                        |
| deleteReply    | Delete the initial response                       |
| createFollowup | Create a followup message                         |
| editFollowup   | Update a followup message, given its ID           |
| deleteFollowup | Delete a followup message, given its ID           |
